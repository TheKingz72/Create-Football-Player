# Create-Football-Player
I created this code in 2020 during my CS class at Jacksonville State University.
## What Does It Do?
This C++ program creates a menu system of football players you created and it reads the player stats from the infile.
## Getting Started
These guides will show you how to download the software and install it on your computer. After that, you'll be able to validate and modify the code to meet the own requirements.
## Prerequisites
For this program to work, you must select the right form of [Dev C++](https://sourceforge.net/projects/dev-cpp/files/Binaries/Dev-C%2B%2B%204.9.9.2/devcpp-4.9.9.2_setup.exe/download) for your operating system.
## Installing
1. Download the application to the place where you want it to live.
2. Test the program to se if it is working.
    * Click on the project Folder
    * Run the Code in Dev C++ and it should show a screen with 4 choices to pick from.
## How to Change The Code
To change the player names and stats from the player, open the text file that i included with the code and change my players name and stats with your own players that you want to add on there.
```
// open the input file
infile.open("question2.txt"); 
```
```
Brice Quarter_Back 56 3 6700 55 890
Dwain Receiver 34 115 0 1500 200
Desmond Corner_Back 5 10 0 400 0
```
I also added additional comments inside the main code incase you need help understanding the code
